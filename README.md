# reddit-top-entries

This is a Vue.js app that connects to the reddit REST API to retrieve the top entries on reddit.

You can check the visual project progress on images from day 1 to day 5 inside the folder [project progress](https://github.com/oscar9214/reddit-top-entries/tree/master/project%20progress).
